# Smart Weather Station

## Overview
This Arduino-based smart weather station measures temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, displaying results on an LCD screen.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor
- BMP180 pressure sensor
- 16x2 LCD display
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## Features
- Real-time temperature, humidity, and pressure readings
- LCD display with current conditions
- Serial output for data logging

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the sensors according to the circuit diagram
2. Upload the Arduino sketch
3. Power the Arduino via USB or external power supply

## What I Learned
- Working with I2C communication protocol
- Reading data from multiple sensors
- Displaying formatted data on an LCD screen
